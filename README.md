# Keras-CNN-For-Image-Processing
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that details the creation, training, and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. The project showcases how CNNs can effectively recognize and classify images by learning complex features through convolutional filters and pooling layers.

# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project
# Overview
This project focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras in a Jupyter notebook. The CNN is designed to process and classify images, which is a common task in the field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

# Model Architecture
The model is a Sequential model with multiple layers including:

- Conv2D layers for feature extraction, each followed by activation functions to introduce non-linearity.
- MaxPooling2D layers to reduce the spatial volume of input features.
- Fully connected layers (Dense) to perform classification based on the features extracted by the Conv2D and MaxPooling layers.
