# Keras-CNN-For-Image-Processing
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that details the creation, training, and evaluation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. The project showcases how CNNs can effectively recognize and classify images by learning complex features through convolutional filters and pooling layers.
